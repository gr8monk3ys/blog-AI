# Brainstorm Session

Let's explore ideas and approaches for your challenge through structured brainstorming.

## Topic: $ARGUMENTS

## Brainstorming Framework

### Phase 1: Problem Understanding

First, let me understand the challenge fully:

**What we're solving:**
- [Restate the problem/goal in my own words]

**Key constraints:**
- [Technical constraints]
- [Business constraints]
- [Resource constraints]

**Success criteria:**
- [What does "done" look like?]
- [How will we measure success?]

### Phase 2: Divergent Thinking

Generate many ideas without judgment:

#### Approach Category A: [Name]
| Idea | Description | Pros | Cons |
|------|-------------|------|------|
| A1 | [Description] | [Pros] | [Cons] |
| A2 | [Description] | [Pros] | [Cons] |
| A3 | [Description] | [Pros] | [Cons] |

#### Approach Category B: [Name]
| Idea | Description | Pros | Cons |
|------|-------------|------|------|
| B1 | [Description] | [Pros] | [Cons] |
| B2 | [Description] | [Pros] | [Cons] |
| B3 | [Description] | [Pros] | [Cons] |

#### Wild Ideas (thinking outside the box)
| Idea | Description | Why it might work |
|------|-------------|-------------------|
| W1 | [Unconventional approach] | [Reasoning] |
| W2 | [Unconventional approach] | [Reasoning] |

### Phase 3: Convergent Thinking

Evaluate and refine the best ideas:

#### Evaluation Matrix
| Criteria | Weight | Idea A1 | Idea B2 | Idea W1 |
|----------|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| Feasibility | 30% | [1-5] | [1-5] | [1-5] |
| Impact | 25% | [1-5] | [1-5] | [1-5] |
| Speed | 20% | [1-5] | [1-5] | [1-5] |
| Risk | 15% | [1-5] | [1-5] | [1-5] |
| Innovation | 10% | [1-5] | [1-5] | [1-5] |
| **Total** | 100% | [Sum] | [Sum] | [Sum] |

### Phase 4: Synthesis

#### Recommended Approach
Based on our brainstorming, I recommend:

**Primary approach:** [Name]
- Why: [Reasoning]
- Key components: [List]
- Risks to mitigate: [List]

**Alternative approach:** [Name]
- When to use: [Conditions]
- Trade-offs: [List]

#### Hybrid Possibilities
Can we combine ideas?
- [Idea A] + [Idea B] = [Combined approach]
- Benefits of combination: [List]

### Phase 5: Questions & Exploration

Before we finalize, let's explore:

1. **Technical Questions**
   - [Question about implementation]
   - [Question about dependencies]

2. **Business Questions**
   - [Question about requirements]
   - [Question about stakeholders]

3. **Risk Questions**
   - [What could go wrong?]
   - [What are the unknowns?]

## Brainstorming Techniques Used

### 1. Mind Mapping
```
                    [Central Topic]
                    /      |      \
            [Branch 1] [Branch 2] [Branch 3]
            /    \        |         /    \
       [Leaf] [Leaf]   [Leaf]   [Leaf] [Leaf]
```

### 2. SCAMPER Method
- **S**ubstitute: What can we replace?
- **C**ombine: What can we merge?
- **A**dapt: What can we borrow from elsewhere?
- **M**odify: What can we change?
- **P**ut to other use: What else could this do?
- **E**liminate: What can we remove?
- **R**earrange: What can we reorder?

### 3. Six Thinking Hats
- 🎩 **White**: Facts and data
- 🔴 **Red**: Emotions and intuition
- ⚫ **Black**: Caution and risks
- 🟡 **Yellow**: Benefits and value
- 🟢 **Green**: Creativity and alternatives
- 🔵 **Blue**: Process and summary

## Output

After brainstorming, you'll have:

1. **Understanding** - Clear problem definition
2. **Options** - Multiple approaches explored
3. **Evaluation** - Objective comparison of ideas
4. **Recommendation** - Best path forward
5. **Questions** - Areas needing more exploration

## Next Steps

After this brainstorm session:
- Use `/write-plan` to create a detailed implementation plan
- Use `/execute-plan` to systematically implement the chosen approach

*Let's start brainstorming! I'll work through each phase and ask clarifying questions as needed.*
